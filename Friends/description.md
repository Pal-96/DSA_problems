## Friends Problem
Consider the number 220. Find the sum of factors, except the number itself (also called as proper divisors)

220 = 1+2+4+5+10+11+20+44+55+110 = 284

Now find the  sum of factors of 284

284 = 1+2+4+71+142 = 220

220 and 284 are call the Friends

Write a program that prints the number of friends between a given range ex. n = 100000000

ans = [0,0] ==> You must fill this

* ans[0] = How many friends are there in n

* ans[1] = number of steps
